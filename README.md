# diskcheck.sh

A simple, resumable file readability scanner for macOS and Linux.

## What it does

- Scans every file on a target disk or folder
- Tests if each file is fully readable (by reading all bytes)
- Logs any unreadable (I/O error) files
- Supports pause and resume (safe to Ctrl+C and restart later)
- Shows progress, percentage, and estimated time remaining

---

## Usage

```bash
sudo ./diskcheck.sh /path/to/target_folder_or_disk
```

Example

```bash
sudo ./diskcheck.sh "/Volumes/MyExternalDrive"
```

## Features

- Progress log: remembers which files were tested (`~/diskcheck_progress.log`)
- Error log: unreadable files are listed in (`~/diskcheck_unreadable_files.txt`)
- Detailed errors: from cat system errors go to (`~/diskcheck_read_errors.log`)
- Resumable: interrupt with Ctrl+C, restart later â€” previously tested files are skipped


## Requirements
- bash (default on macOS/Linux)
- no other dependencies

## Limitations
- Only checks readability (basic I/O health)
- It does not verify data against checksums like SHA256
- If you need cryptographic verification, combine with md5sum or shasum
